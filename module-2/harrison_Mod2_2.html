        <h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: A Brief Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I was raised in the vibrant and diverse city of Los Angeles, California, which has always offered a unique
            background for life and learning. Growing up, I developed a strong interest in music, particularly the
            clarinet, which taught me the invaluable skill of reading sheet music. This experience gave me a deep
            appreciation for structure and composition, a quality I find useful even in coding.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have one sibling, and we are quite close, often spending our time engaging in various forms of competitive
            and cooperative gaming. Whether we are tackling challenging co-op levels or going head-to-head in strategy
            games, it's a great way for us to connect and unwind.
            <span class="sentence">This consistent time spent collaborating and problem-solving has naturally transferred
                to my approach in team-based academic work.</span>
            Our shared interest keeps our family bond strong and our weekends fun.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of family and school, my primary passion is learning how to trade the stock market. This complex and
            fast-moving world requires constant research and analysis, which keeps me continually engaged and curious.
            Understanding market dynamics is a constant exercise in critical thinking, similar to debugging a tricky
            piece of code.
        </p>

        <p>
            This interest in finance and analysis is what often fills my weekends, as I track market trends and refine my
            trading strategies. I am very excited to see how the technical skills I gain in CSD 340 will complement my
            existing analytical abilities. I am confident that building a strong foundation in development will help me
            achieve my long-term career goals.
